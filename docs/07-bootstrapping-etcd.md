# Bootstrapping the etcd Cluster

Kubernetes components are stateless and store cluster state in [etcd](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd). In this lab you will bootstrap a single node etcd cluster.

## Prerequisites

Copy `etcd` binaries and systemd unit files to the `server` machine:

```bash
scp \
  downloads/controller/etcd \
  downloads/client/etcdctl \
  units/etcd.service \
  root@server:~/
```

The commands in this lab must be run on the `server` machine. Login to the `server` machine using the `ssh` command. Example:

```bash
ssh root@server
```

### SELinux

SELinux is an integral part of RHEL security. While performing the steps in this tutorial, we would have to manage the SELinux configuration for each and every Kubernetes component.

For the sake of this tutorial, let us set SELinux to `permissive` and reboot each node:

```bash
for host in server node-0 node-1; do
  ssh root@${host} "sed -i 's/enforcing/permissive/' /etc/selinux/config; reboot"
done
```

## Bootstrapping an etcd Cluster

### Install the etcd Binaries

Extract and install the `etcd` server and the `etcdctl` command line utility:

```bash
mv etcd etcdctl /usr/local/bin/
```

### Configure the etcd Server

```bash
{
  mkdir -p /etc/etcd /var/lib/etcd
  chmod 700 /var/lib/etcd
  cp ca.crt kube-api-server.key kube-api-server.crt \
    /etc/etcd/
}
```

Each etcd member must have a unique name within an etcd cluster. Set the etcd name to match the hostname of the current compute instance:

Create the `etcd.service` systemd unit file:

```bash
mv etcd.service /etc/systemd/system/
```

### Start the etcd Server

```bash
{
  systemctl daemon-reload
  systemctl enable etcd
  systemctl start etcd
}
```

## Verification

List the etcd cluster members:

```bash
etcdctl member list
```

```text
6702b0a34e2cfd39, started, controller, http://127.0.0.1:2380, http://127.0.0.1:2379, false
```
